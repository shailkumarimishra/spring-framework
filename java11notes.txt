JPMS(Java Platform Module System):-

Difference between jar file and java Module:-
1. Jar is a group of packages and each package contains several classes.

   Module is also a group of packages and each package contains several classes.Module can also contain one 
   special file module-info.java to hold module specific dependencies and configuration information.
   
2. In jar file their is no way to specify dependent jar file information but in java module their is a special
   module-info.java to specify the dependent jar.
   
3. Their is no way to check all jar file dependencies at the beginning hence in the middle of the program
   execution their may be a chance of NoClassDefFoundError. but in java module jvm will check all the module
   dependencies at the beginning with the help of module-info.java and if any dependencies is missing then
   it will not use the application hence their is no chance of NoClassDefFoundError.
   
4. In the class path the order of jar files are important and jvm will always consider from left to right for the
   required .class file. If multiple jar contains the same .class jar file then their may be a chance of version 
   conflict and results abnormal behaviour of our application.
	
   But in the module path order is not important jvm will always check from the dependent module only for the 
   required .class files. Hence their is no chance of version conflict and results abnormal behaviour of 
   our application. 
	
5. In jar file there is no mechanism to control access to the packages. Everything present in the jar file
   is public to everyone. Anyone can access any component from the jar file. Hence there may be a chance 
   of security problem.
   
   But in module there is a mechanism to control access to the package. Only exported packages are visual to
   other modules hence there is no chance of security problem.
   
6. jar follows monolithic structure and aplication will become heavy weight and not suitable for small devices.
   
   But module follows distributed structure and aplications will become light weighted and suitable for small
   devices.
   
7. jar files approach can be used for iot devices but module based approach can be used for iot devices.
