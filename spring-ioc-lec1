Q1*** What is dependency injection and what are the advantages?
Ans:- Dependency injection is a technique in which objects do not create their dependencies on itself, instead
	  objects declared dependency that they need and it is external object job or framework job to provide 
	  concreate dependencies to objects.
		
	Types of Dependency injection:-
	1. Setter injection
	2. Constructor injection
	
	Advantages of using Dependency injection are:-
	1. To increase code reusability.
	2. To increase code readability.
	3. To increase code maintainability.
	4. To increase code testability.
	5. To reduce coupling.
	6. To increase cohesion.
	
Q2. what is lazy loading & eager loading?

Q3. Injecting various types of bean properties with setter injection & constructor injection.
	bean may contain following properties type:-
	1. Simple types (example-> all primitives, wrappers, String & Date)
	2. List of Simple type 
	3. Set of Simple type
	4. Map of Simple type
	5. Other bean type (reference type)
	6. Collection of other bean type (like customer, student type)
	7. Properties of Simple type
	
Q4*** Types of Scope in Spring:-
	1. Singleton (default Scope)
	2. Prototype
	3. Session
	4. Request
	5. Global Session (Out of Syllabus)
	
I) Singleton Scope:-
	When bean scope is singleton then only one instance will be created for that bean and same instance 
	will be returned when you call getBean() method.
	
	Singleton is the default scope in the spring container.
	when scope is Singleton the default loading will be aggressive loading.
	
II) Prototype Scope:-
	when bean scope is Prototype then new instance will be created for the bean when you call getBean() method.
	
	Default loading type will be lazy loading.
	
III) Session Scope:-
	 It is equals to HTTPSession in the web application.
	 
IV) Request Scope:-
	 It is equals to HTTPSession in the web application.
	 
V)  Global Scope:-
	 It is equals to the session in the portlet based application.
	 
Q. How can we configure scope in xml file?
Ans :- <bean id="emp" class="com.ioc.demo.Employee" scope="prototype" lazy-init="true"> 

->***  Eager Loading or Aggressive Loading:-

	In the case of Eager Loading all the beans will be loaded, instanciated and initialized by the container at 
	container start of time.
	
	<bean id="emp" class="com.ioc.demo.Employee" scope="prototype" lazy-init="false">
	
->***  Lazy Loading:-
	
	In the case of Lazy Loading all the beans will be loaded, instanciated and initialized when you/container 
	try to call getBean() method
	
	<bean id="emp" class="com.ioc.demo.Employee" scope="prototype" lazy-init="true">
	
->	Wiring*** :-
	Wiring is the process of injecting the dependencies of the beans.
	It can be done in 2 ways:-
	a) Explicit Wiring
	b) Implicit Wiring/Auto Wiring.
	 
a)  Explicit Wiring:-
	In the case of Explicit Wiring you have to specify the beans dependencies explicitly then container will
	inject those depencies.
	<beans>
	<bean id="stu" class="com.ioc.demo.Student">
		<!-- Simple types -->
	   <property name="name" value="Anu"/>
	   <property name="sid" value="10"/>
	   <property name="phoneNo" value="1234"/>
	</bean>
	</beans>
	
b)  Auto Wiring/Implicit Wiring:-
	In the case of Auto Wiring spring container detects the bean dependencies automatically and injects those 
	dependencies.
	<bean id="add" class="com.ioc.demo.Address" autowire="***">
	following are possible values of Auto wire Attributes:-
	1. By Name:-  <bean id="add" class="com.ioc.demo.Address" autowire="byName">
	    
	2. By Type:- <bean id="add" class="com.ioc.demo.Address" autowire="byType">
	
	3. Constructor:- <bean id="add" class="com.ioc.demo.Address" autowire="constructor">
	4. Auto detect:-
	
1. byName:-
	when auto wired value is byName then spring container checks whether any beans instance running in the 
	container whose name or ID is same as the property(variable) name or not.
	
	If bean is found with matching name then it will be injected otherwise property remains uninjected.
	bean will be instanciated using default constructor.
	Dependent beans instances will be detected using bean name.
	detected beans instances will be injected through setter injection only.
	
Q1) What happend at container startup time?
Ans:- step1- Loads and initilise(calling default constructor) all the beans according to beans entry in xml file.  
      
	  step2- Independent beans initilise their property first then dependent beans means property 
			 initilization will happen bottom to top by calling setter() method.
	  
	  step3- Spring container will check any autowire value is specified or not.
	  
				a) byName - If autowired value is byName then spring container will check any bean is running in
							the container with the specified property(variable)name or not.
							If bean is found with specified name then container will initilize the bean otherwise
							it will not initilise.
							
				b) byType - When autowire attribute value is byType then spring container will check whether any
							bean instance is running the container whose type(classType) is same as property type
							or not.
							
                  Case1- If exactly one bean is found with matching type then it will be injected.
				  
                  Case2- If 0 bean is found with matching type then bean property remains uninjected.
				  
                  Case3- If two or more beans are found with the matching type then exception will be thrown 
						 called "UnsatisfiedDependencyException".				  
				
				c) constructor - When autowire attribute value is constructor then spring container will check
								 whether any bean instance is running in the container whose type(classType) is 
								 same as property type or not.
								 Depending on the availability of bean instances spring container will identify
								 the matching constructor and invoke the constructor to inject the dependency.
					
					Case1- If 0 bean is found with matching type then property remain uninjected.
					
					Case2- If exactly one bean is found with matching type and with matching constructor then 
					       it will be injected.
						   
					Case3- If exactly one bean is found with matching type and without matching constructor then 
					       bean property remains uninjected (will throw exception "UnsatisfiedDependencyException").
						   
					Case4- If 2 or more beans are found with matching type then container will try to pick one
						   bean from available multiple beans based on byName autowire process first.
						   
						   If bean is not selected based on byName autowire process then container will simply 
						   ignore it and property remains uninjected.
