AOP (Aspect Oriented programming):-
->	AOP is a new kind of programming technique which is mainly used to seperate cross cutting 
	concerns(commonly required middle level services) from core bussiness logic of the application.
	Without AOP:-
	class AccountServices{
		//LogService...middle level services 
		public void deposit(double amount){//....bussiness logic
			if(amount>= balance){
				try{
					log.info("");//...middle level services
					transaction.begin();//...middle level services
					//operation1....   //....bussiness logic
				    //operation2....   //....bussiness logic
					//operation3....   //....bussiness logic
					transaction.commit();//...middle level services
					log.info("");//...middle level services
				}catch(Exception e){
					transaction.rollBack();//...middle level services
					log.error();//...middle level services
				 }
			}
		}
	}
	In the above code, core bussiness logic is mixed with middle level services like logging and transaction.
	If you want to change existing transaction API or logging API with new one then you need to modify the entire 
	application which may give maintenance problem.
	
	With AOP:-
	class AccountServices{
		public void deposit(double amount){
			//operation1...
			//operation2...
			//operation3...
		}
	}
	
	classs TransactionServices{
		public void begin(){
			
		}
		public void commit(){
		}
		public void rollBack(){
		}
		
	}
	
	class LogService{
		public void log(){
		}
	}
	
	class SecurityServices{
		public void verifyUser(){
		}
	}
	
	class Client{
		try{
			ss.verifyUser();
			ls.log();
			tx.begin();
			as.deposit();
			tx.commit();
		}catch(Exception e){
			ls.error();
			tx.rollBack();
		 }
	}
	
	In the above code, core bussiness logic is completely seperated from middle level services.
	If you want to change existing transaction, security or logging implementations with new one then that will
	not impact the bussiness services.
	
Spring AOP Terminology:-
1. Aspects:- Commonly required middle level services(security, transaction, logging) which you are implementing
			 for enterprise application are called as Aspects.

2. Advice:- Implementation of a middle level services(Aspect) is called as Advice. 
			i.e; Advice is a class that contains code for Aspects like security, transaction, logging.

3. JoinPoint:- JoinPoint is a point in the programme execution pair where you want to apply 
			   Advice (to run middle level services code).
			   Spring AOP supports the following JoinPoint:-
			   a) methodBefore()
			   b) methodReturning()
			   c) methodThrowing()
			   
4. PointCut:- PointCut is a collection of JoinPoint.

5. Advisor:- Advisor is a combination of Advice and PointCut.

6. Target:- Target is an object of your bussiness service after applying the Advices or Advisors.

7. Proxy:- Proxy is an object of your bussiness service before applying the Advices or Advisors.

8. Weaving:- Weaving is the process of applying the Advices or Advisors to the target object at given PointCut
			 to get the Proxy object.

PointCut Designators-
1. execution-
2. within-
3. this-
4. target-
5. args(arguments)-
6. @args-
7. @target-
8. @within-
9. @annotation-

-> How to write PointCut Definition:- 

The execution of any public method
	execution(public * *(..))
	
The execution of any method that begins with ambe
	execution(* ambe*(..))
	
The execution of any public method with no argument	
	execution(public * *())

The execution of any public method with one argument of any type
	execution(public * *(*))	

The execution of any public method with one argument of String type	
	execution(public * *(String)) 
	
The execution of any public method with any number of arguments (0 or more) of any type	
	execution(public * *(..))

The execution of any public method that takes first parameter of any type & second parameter of String type	
	execution(public * *(*,String))
	
The execution of any method defined by the customerService interface present in com.ambe.service package
	execution(* com.ambe.service.CustomerService.*(..))
	
The execution of show and display method defined by the customerService interface present in com.ambe.service 
package	
	execution(* com.ambe.service.CustomerService.show(..) && * com.ambe.service.CustomerService.display(..))
	or
	execution(* com.ambe.service.CustomerService.show(..))
	execution(* com.ambe.service.CustomerService.display(..))

The execution of any method defined in the package com.ambe.service
	execution(* com.ambe.service.*.*(..))

The execution of any method defined in the com.ambe.service package or one of it's sub packages
	execution(* com.ambe.service..*.*(..))
	
Any joint point (method execution only in spring AOP) within the package com.ambe.service
	within(com.ambe.service.*)

Any joint point (method execution only in spring AOP) within the package com.ambe.service or one of it's
sub packages
	within(com.ambe.service..*)
